## Dataset
The dataset is a survey conducted in 2020 among technology 
employees. It includes their various job titles, seniority levels, 
salaries and years of experience. The dataset also holds 
numerous attributes to the participants like their genders, ages, 
their employment contracts, types and company sizes they work 
for, as well as other attributes. In addition to that, it also presents 
the impact of Covid-19 on their careers
## phase 1
The phase adopts a goal-based approach to the dataset. The goal is to 
explore what factors affect tech employeeâ€™s income the most. To reach 
this goal, five questions were proposed. The five questions aim to 
analyze five different factors that are believed to affect the generated 
income. Those five factors are years of experience, gender roles, covid19, company sizes and job positions. The questions are as follows
Are years of experience in Germany on average more valuable than years of experience outside of Germany?
Are male employees generating more income than female employees?
During corona virus in 2020, which tech job titles were lost?
Which job titles generate the highest income in small-sized, mid-sized and large-sized
Which job title values years of experience the most?
## phase 2 
The phase adopts a further random analysis-based approach. There is no 
one desired goal to be reached. The questions are tailored in a random 
manner trying to identify if there are patterns in different areas. Two of 
the main focuses in this phase are comparing positions between 
Germany and Singapore and also discovering the possibilities of 
working indoors as well as abroad
